% Post-Processing Scripts

There may be times when the G-Code generated by Slic3r has to be tweaked
or modified after it has been created. For this reason there exists the
ability to run arbitrary scripts as part of the final steps in the
slicing process[^1].

In the `Output options` section of the `Print Settings` tab lies the
`Post-processing scripts` option. The absolute path to each script can
be added, separated by semicolons. Each scripts should be recognised by
the host system, and be executable.

option.](images/post_processing_scripts/post_processing_scripts_options.png "fig:")


Each script will be passed the absolute path of the G-Code file that
Slic3r generates. All Slic3r configuration options are made available to
the scripts by way of environment variables. These all begin with
`SLIC3R_`. The following script would write out all Slic3r options to
standard output:



            #!/bin/sh
            echo "Post-processing G-code file: $*"
            env | grep ^SLIC3R



Example scripts can be found in the GitHub repository[^2].

Perlâ€™s in-place mode (`perl -i`) makes it easy to modify the contents of
the G-Code file, without having to copy, edit, then replace the
original. The following example will simply output the contents to
standard output:



            #!/usr/bin/perl -i
            use strict;
            use warnings;

            while (<>) {
                 # modify $_ here before printing
                 print;
            }
